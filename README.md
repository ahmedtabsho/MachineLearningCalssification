## Introduction

In our latest project, "IA," we aimed to enhance road safety by teaching machines to recognize and understand traffic signs. Unlike the prevalent use of deep learning, we opted for simpler machine learning algorithms. This choice allowed us to explore various classic methods to accurately identify traffic signs.

We began our project by acquiring a well-organized dataset containing labeled images of various traffic signs. This dataset became the foundation for training our machine learning algorithms. The diverse collection of images provided our models with a robust base for learning and performing effectively.

To achieve our goal, we employed a mix of different machine learning algorithms, including:
- K Neighbors Classifier
- MLP Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- CatBoost Classifier
- LGBM Classifier

Each algorithm was selected for specific reasons, contributing to our understanding of the complexities involved in recognizing traffic signs.

While many turn to deep learning for such projects, we chose to explore traditional machine learning methods. By doing so, we aimed to demonstrate that excellent results can still be achieved using simpler, more interpretable techniques.

In this article, we share our journey, discussing the experiences and challenges we faced. Most importantly, we reveal the outcomes of using various machine learning methods for recognizing traffic signs. Join us as we explore the intersection of technology and transportation, working towards smarter and safer roads.
